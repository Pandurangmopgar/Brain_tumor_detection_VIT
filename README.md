# Tumor Detection Using Vision Transformers (ViT)

## Introduction
This project applies the cutting-edge Vision Transformer (ViT) model to the field of medical imaging, specifically for the detection of tumors. Our implementation of ViT is fine-tuned to analyze and identify tumor presence in medical scans with high accuracy, leveraging the power of transformer models, which have shown great promise in various fields of computer vision.

## Project Overview
Vision Transformers are a breakthrough in machine learning, originally designed for image recognition tasks. In this project, we adapt ViT to the specific needs and challenges of tumor detection in medical images. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of  MRI scans of brain , enabling it to recognize a wide range of tumor types.
